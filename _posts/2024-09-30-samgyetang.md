This is a twist on the classic chicken and ginseng soup, full of nutrients and flavor. 

I referenced [this recipe](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/samgyetang) when creating my dish, though the addition of the nagaimo and extra jujubes in my recipe makes it darker, sweeter, and slightly more filling than the original.

### Samgyetang
- Prep time: 24 hours
- Cook time: 2.5 hours

### Ingredients (Serves 1, multiply ingredients and use a bigger pot for more people)
- 1 cornish hen
- 1 cup rice
- 6 dried jujubes
- 1 finger-sized piece of dried ginseng
- 6 inch length of nagaimo
- salt
- dried goji berry (optional)
- scallions (optional)

### Directions
1. Soak the dried ginseng for 24 hours, and slice it up
2. Defrost and clean the inside of the cornish hen
3. Peel and cut the nagaimo into stew-sized chunks
4. Fill the chicken most of the way with rice, and stuff the end with 3 jujubes (the other 3 go into the soup)
5. Put everything besides the scallion into a pot, bring to a boil, then simmer
6. After 15-30 minutes, skim off the foam that floats to the top and stir
7. Once the soup darkens and becomes aromatic (maybe 2-3 hours), it is ready to serve
8. Salt to taste and add the diced green onion as a garnish
