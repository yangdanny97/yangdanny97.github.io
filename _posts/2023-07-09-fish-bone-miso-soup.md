This is a quick recipe for a light and savory soup that you can make with fish bones. Normally these get thrown away, but you might as well make them into something good. If you don't have any lying around, don't worry. Fish bones are dirt-cheap at Asian supermarkets; you can probably buy them for $1-2/lb.

Note that the bones are a choking hazard, so be careful while eating and don't serve this to kids.
