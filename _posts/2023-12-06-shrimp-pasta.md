This one was inspired by Gordon Ramsay's [10 minute shrimp scampi recipe](https://www.gordonramsay.com/gr/recipes/ramsay-in-10-shrimp-scampi-with-capellini-pasta/), but I've made enough changes that I don't think it qualifies as shrimp scampi anymore.

### Shrimp Pasta
- Prep time: 10 min
- Cook time: 15 min

### Ingredients (Serves 2)
- dry spaghetti (or angel hair, but I like spaghetti more)
- salt, pepper, olive oil
- 10-15 grape tomatoes
- 2-3 cups spinach
- 10-15 shrimp
- 2 tsp minced garlic
- 1 cup diced shallots (substitute onions in a pinch)
- your favorite cheese (optional)
- white wine for deglazing (optional)

### Directions
1. Bring pot of salted water to a boil
2. Cook desired quantity of spaghetti according to package instructions
3. Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large frying pan.
4. Add in shrimp and garlic, reduce heat to medium-low, and season with salt and pepper.
5. Cook shrimp 1 minute each side, then remove and set aside.
6. Add spinach, tomatoes and shallots to pan. Sprinkle some salt and pepper.
7. Deglaze with white wine or a spoonful of pasta water.
8. Cover and cook on low heat for 2 minutes, then uncover and move things around for another minute or two.
9. Once pasta is ready, drain it and add it back to the pot. I like to keep a small amount of pasta water left in the pot.
10. Mix contents of frying pan into pasta, add more olive oil or pasta water if necessary.
11. Serve with your favorite cheese grated on top.
