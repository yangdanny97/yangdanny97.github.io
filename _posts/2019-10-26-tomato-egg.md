I decided that it would be a good idea to start writing down recipes for foods that I like to cook and eat, and today we'll start off with something simple: Tomato and Egg. 

Growing up in a Chinese household, this dish was commonplace in my family and remains one of my favorite dishes to make. The mild acidity makes it an appetizing meal despite being very lightly seasoned.

### Tomato and Egg
- Prep time: 5 minutes
- Cook time: 10 minutes

### Ingredients (serves 2)
- eggs (3)
- tomatoes (1 large one or 2 smaller ones)
- salt
- sugar (optional)

### Directions
1. Dice the tomatoes and set them aside - I usually cut each one into 8-12 pieces depending on the size. Optionally add a small dash of sugar.
2. Crack the eggs into a container and mix them up
3. Put the tomatoes in a heated pan, and cook them on medium until they start to look/feel soft (~4-6 mins). If you're afraid of the tomatoes drying out, you can add a tiny bit of water or put a lid on the pan.
4. Put the eggs in, and stir so the eggs get blended into the tomatoes.
5. Add salt and cook eggs while stirring occasionally so that the egg does not stick to the bottom of the pan (~2 mins). Remove when eggs have solidified, do not overcook.
6. Serve immediately with white rice or plain Asian noodles (without soup).
