I first got into cafe-hopping when I was writing my book - I would sit and write in a different cafe every weekend for a change of environment. Later on it sort of became a regular hobby of mine to sit in a cafe and read, work, or people-watch. I'm not very particular about my coffee - I really don't have strong preferences aside from liking dark roast and taking most drinks unsweetened. The cafes in this list all have good coffee from what I can tell, but I mostly differentiate them based on other things like tea, food, service, and vibes.

Think of this post as my personal Michelin guide for cafes, rated using the familiar 3-star system. This page is very much a WIP since I'm still in the process of cataloging the cafes that I've visited in the last few years.

## Amazing Cafes ⭐️⭐️⭐️

Cafes that I specifically took a trip to visit, that lived up to the hype.

### Bugcat Capoo Cafe - Taichung

I had been following their Instagram account for years, so when I went to Taiwan I took a train to Taichung just to visit this shop. Besides the very Instagrammable food and drinks, they also sell a lot of merch for their mascots, from clothing to pins. The thing that makes this one stand out from a lot of other theme cafes is that it's not a pop-up - the location is permanent so the food and drink they serve is higher quality than a typical pop-up theme cafe (they tasted as good as they looked!). One warning is that this place is quite expensive compared to the average cafe in Taiwan - the prices are more similar to American cafe prices.

## Great Cafes ⭐️⭐️

Cafes that I would probably detour to visit if I pass through the area.

### Open Air Coffee - Richmond, CA

This is a really unique cafe, probably my favorite in the entire SF bay area. The cafe is located in the empty parking lot of a restaurant/catering business, using repurposed giant wire spools as tables. It only opens on weekends and seems to be popular with local cyclists thanks to its location near the bay trail. The vibe is unbeatable when it's a nice day and you can feel the sea breeze. 

Every time I pass through Richmond on a weekend I always stop by this shop to enjoy a coffee and some of the best mochi cake I've ever had (in fact, every pastry I've had from this has been fantastic). From what I hear, the cakes and pastries are made by the pastry chef at said restaurant. A couple years ago they also had a wood-fired pizza oven outside and served freshly made pizzas for lunch, but unfortunately that's no longer a thing.

### Main Street Commissary - Singapore

I stumbled on this cafe on accident on a mission to visit Putien (a Michelin-starred Chinese restaurant). I'm really glad I stepped inside for a quick break - it was quiet and relaxing, and the drink I had was great (pea flower lemonade). On the walls, they were exhibiting a collection of artwork on the topic of breakups, which I felt added a bittersweet flavor to the vibes inside. Overall, definitely a unique and enjoyable time.

### The Depot Cafe and Bookstore - Mill Valley, CA

This cafe has fantastic early morning vibes, especially for grabbing breakfast right before a hike or bike ride in the beautiful landscape of Marin County. As the name suggests, there's an adjacent bookstore - perfect for picking up a book to read with your coffee.

## Good Cafes ⭐️

### For the Record - Greenpoint, NYC

This cafe doubles as a record store, and has enough space to run various workshops on the weekends.

### Lately Cafe - Long Island City, NYC

Great place to read - cozy, not too crowded, really good sandwiches and toast.

### World Traveler Coffee and Tea - Folsom, CA

I have a lot of fond memories of this cafe in my hometown, though these days it's somewhat overshadowed by Temple. The loose leaf tea selection is very affordable, and they have a surprisingly large offering of pretty-looking mousse cakes.

### Petaluma Coffee & Tea Company - Petaluma, CA

I will admit I was baited in by their $1 coffee promotional sign outside, but I'm glad I checked it out. Inside was very cozy, with a bright and homey feeling (if your house had a coffee roaster in the living room) and great drinks.

### Lever Coffee - Alamo, CA

This is probably my favorite coffee shop along the Iron Horse Trail in the East Bay. I remember their specialty latte being quite good, and the outdoor seating had nice views.
