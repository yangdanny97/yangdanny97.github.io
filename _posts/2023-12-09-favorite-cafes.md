I first got into cafe-hopping when I was writing my book - I would sit and write in a different cafe every weekend for a change of environment. Later on it sort of became a regular hobby of mine to sit in a cafe and read, work, or people-watch.

I'm not very particular about my coffee - I really don't have strong preferences aside from liking dark roast and taking most drinks unsweetened. Assuming the coffee is decent, ratings are often differentiated by other factors like tea, food, service, and overall vibes.

This page is very much a WIP since I'm still in the process of cataloging the cafes that I've visited in the last few years.

## Recommended Cafes

### Bugcat Capoo Cafe - Taichung

I had been following their Instagram account for years, so when I went to Taiwan I took a train to Taichung just to visit this shop. Besides the very Instagrammable food and drinks, they also sell a lot of merch for their mascots, from clothing to pins. The thing that makes this one stand out from a lot of other theme cafes is that it's not a pop-up - the location is permanent so the food and drink they serve is higher quality than a typical pop-up theme cafe (they tasted as good as they looked!). One warning is that this place is quite expensive compared to the average cafe in Taiwan - the prices are more similar to American cafe prices.

### Main Street Commissary - Singapore

I stumbled on this cafe on accident on a mission to visit Putien (a Michelin-starred Chinese restaurant). I'm really glad I stepped inside for a quick break - it was quiet and relaxing, and the drink I had was great (pea flower lemonade). On the walls, they were exhibiting a collection of artwork on the topic of breakups, which I felt added a bittersweet flavor to the vibes inside. Overall, definitely a unique and enjoyable time.

### The Depot Cafe and Bookstore - Mill Valley, California

This cafe has fantastic early morning vibes, especially for grabbing breakfast right before a hike or bike ride in the beautiful landscape of Marin County. As the name suggests, there's an adjacent bookstore - perfect for picking up a book to read with your coffee.

### Lever Coffee - Alamo, California

This is probably my favorite coffee shop along the Iron Horse Trail in the East Bay. I remember their specialty latte being quite good, and the outdoor seating had nice views.

### Open Air Coffee - Richmond, California

This is a really unique cafe, probably my favorite in the entire SF bay area. The cafe is a mini trailer located in the empty parking lot of a restaurant/catering business, using repurposed giant wire spools as tables. It only opens on weekends and seems to be popular with local cyclists thanks to its location near the bay trail. The vibe is unbeatable when it's a nice day and you can feel the sea breeze. 

Every time I pass through Richmond on a weekend I always stop by this shop to enjoy a coffee, though they no longer sell my favorite item, the mochi cake.

### Teahouse by Calmplex, Manhattan, NYC

Located in the basement of a pottery studio, this cafe serves really good matcha and has a pleasant atmosphere.

## Honorable Mentions

### Little Banchan Shop - Long Island City, NYC

This isn't even a coffee shop - it sells Korean side dishes by day and houses Meju, a Michelin-starred restaurant, in the back. It also serves the best einspanner I've had in NYC.

### World Traveler Coffee and Tea - Folsom, California

I have a lot of fond memories of this cafe in my hometown, though these days it's somewhat overshadowed by Temple. The loose leaf tea selection is very affordable and they have a surprisingly large offering of pretty-looking mousse cakes, though they no longer sell my favorite item, the almond tart.

### Perkatory Coffee - Hartford, CT

Surprisingly great coffee in the outskirts of Hartford. Great pit stop if you're driving to/from Boston.

### Three Legged Cat - Williamsburg, NYC

### Spigolo Coffee - Pittsburgh, PA

### Petaluma Coffee & Tea Company - Petaluma, California

I will admit I was lured in by their $1 coffee promotional sign outside, but I'm glad I checked it out. Inside was very cozy, with a bright and homey feeling (if your house had a coffee roaster in the living room) and great drinks.
