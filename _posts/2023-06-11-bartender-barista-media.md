This post is a list of examples of a rather niche genre of media I like to call the bartender/barista genre.

For years I've enjoyed this type of media without really knowing what it's called, but I figured I could start compiling a list. I'll keep this post updated as I come across more examples.

To fit the genre, the following criteria have to be met:

1. the main/recurring character works as a bartender or barista
2. the bar/coffee house that the main character works is the primary location
3. any overarching story (if any) is primarily driven by other characters - in other words, the main character is less of an active protagonist and more of an observer

Many examples I've seen fall into the slice-of-life genre, making them good for relaxation/unwinding after a long day. Video games of this genre are primarily text-based, similar to visual novels.

# Midnight Diner (Netflix)

A long-running show about ordinary people who eat in a small restaurant that opens from midnight until 7AM. 

# Death Parade (Anime)

A supernatural anime about a bar that receives the souls of the recently-deceased, and the bartender that judges them. 

# Necrobarista (Game)

You work in a Melbourne coffee-house staffed by necromancers, where the living can mingle with the recently deceased. Unlike other text-based games, the scenes are 3D and animated, with dynamic camera angles leading to a very immersive presentation.

# VA-11 Hall-A (Game)

A bartending game with a cyberpunk aesthetic and a fantastic soundtrack. Making drinks is a minigame, and you have to learn about your regulars to know which drink they want that night.

# Coffee Talk (Game)

You run a coffee shop in a world full of supernatural creatures (think elves, vampires, etc). Similar to VA-11 Hall-A, making coffee and doing latte art is a minigame.
