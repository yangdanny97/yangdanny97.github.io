This post is a list of examples of a rather niche genre of media I like to call the bartender/barista genre.

For years I've enjoyed this type of media without really knowing what it's called, but I figured I could start compiling a list. I'll keep this post updated as I come across more examples.

To fit the genre, the following criteria have to be met:

1. the main/recurring character works as a bartender or barista
2. the bar/coffee house that the main character works is the primary location
3. any overarching story (if any) is primarily driven by other characters - in other words, the main character is less of an active protagonist and more of an observer

Many examples I've seen are pretty episodic and fall into the slice-of-life genre, making them good for relaxation/unwinding after a long day. Video games of this genre are primarily text-based, similar to visual novels.

## [Midnight Diner](https://www.netflix.com/title/80113037) (Netflix)

A live-action show about ordinary people who eat in a small restaurant that opens from midnight until 7AM. The nighttime setting adds to the peaceful vibes.

## Death Parade (Anime)

A supernatural anime about a bar that receives the souls of the recently-deceased, and the bartender that judges them. 

## [Necrobarista](https://store.steampowered.com/app/725270/Necrobarista/) (Game)

You work in a Melbourne coffee-house staffed by necromancers, where the living can mingle with the recently deceased. Unlike other text-based games, the scenes are 3D and animated, with dynamic camera angles leading to a very immersive presentation.

## [VA-11 Hall-A](https://store.steampowered.com/app/447530/VA11_HallA_Cyberpunk_Bartender_Action/) (Game)

A bartending game with a cyberpunk aesthetic and a fantastic soundtrack. Making drinks is a minigame, and you have to learn about your regulars to know which drink they want that night. The worldbuilding in this game was done very well - learning about the world through conversations with customers was my favorite part of the game.

There's a sequel called [N1RV Ann-A](https://store.steampowered.com/app/914210/N1RV_AnnA_Cyberpunk_Bartender_Action/) in development.

## [Coffee Talk](https://store.steampowered.com/app/914800/Coffee_Talk/) (Game)

You run a coffee shop in a world full of supernatural creatures (think elves, vampires, etc). Similar to VA-11 Hall-A, making coffee and doing latte art is a minigame.

There's a sequel called [Coffee Talk Part 2: Hibiscus and Butterfly](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663220/Coffee_Talk_Episode_2_Hibiscus__Butterfly/)
