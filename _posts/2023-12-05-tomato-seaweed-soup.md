Sour soups are good to have before meals because they are appetizing (think: hot and sour soup from Panda Express), but this recipe is far lighter and more watered-down than the restaurant version. Also, it's not spicy.

I actually prefer this soup to be quite bland aside from the sour flavor, but I think it's probably too bland for most people's tastes - one option to add more flavor is to use some sort of japanese soup base or a spoonful of miso paste at the beginning.

### Tomato Seaweed Soup
- Prep time: 5 min
- Cook time: 20 min

### Ingredients (Serves 2-3)
- 1-2 tomatoes, sliced into wedges
- 1 onion, diced
- 2 eggs
- vinegar
- a fistful of dried laver
- thinly sliced mushroom (white mushrooms or fresh shiitake)

### Directions
1. Add tomatoes, mushroom, and onion into pot of salted water and bring to a boil.
2. Reduce heat and simmer for around 10 minutes.
3. Crack eggs directly into soup and stir aggressively to break them up. There should be strips/chunks of varying colors, but not as fine or uniform as in egg drop soup.
4. Mix in laver and simmer for another 2 minutes.
5. Add vinegar and additional seasoning of your choice to taste, and serve.
