This is my simple variant of bulgogi, it's relatively quick to make and goes well with white rice. My recipe tends to have a higher beef:onion ratio than what is served at most restaurants.

### Ingredients (serves 2)
- thin-sliced steak (1lb, shabu-shabu style)
- Bibigo marinade
- onion (1 cooking onion or 1/2 of a regular onion)
- sesame seeds (optional)

### Directions
1. Marinate the beef following the instructions on the marinade packaging, and set it in the fridge for half an hour. Use just enough sauce to coat the beef, any more is a waste.
2. Cut up the onion and set them aside.
3. Once the beef is ready, take it out of the fridge and heat oil in the pan on medium-high.
4. Put the beef into the pan, a little at a time so that all the beef can have contact with the bottom of the pan. You might need to separate the meat into a few batches. Don't let too much marinade drip into the pan.
5. When the beef looks cooked and the sauce is dried (~2 minutes), remove it immediately. It is very easy to overcook beef that is sliced this thinly, but we also don't want to have excess sauce.
6. Once you're done cooking the beef, deglaze the pan and cook the onions. 
7. Finally, mix the beef and the onion, top with sesame seeds, and serve.
