This is a nice and easy recipe for mapo tofu, excellent for winter. I don't handle spice well so the sauce I use is really not that spicy, but I'm sure it would still taste good if you added some peppers.

### Mapo Tofu:
- Prep time: 5 minutes
- Cook time: 20 minutes

### Ingredients (serves 2-3)
- 1/2 lb ground pork
- 14 oz soft/silken tofu (one box)
- half a jar of Lee Kum Kee mapo sauce
- oil
- salt
- pepper
- garlic powder

### Directions
1. Cut the tofu into 3/4" cubes
2. Heat some oil in a pan on medium, and add the pork to the pan
3. Once the pork is broken up, season with salt/pepper/garlic powder and stir.
4. When the pork is cooked, add the tofu and the mapo sauce, and stir. If it looks really dry, feel free to add a splash of water.
5. Reduce the stove to medium-low, put a lid on the pan and continue to cook it for another 10 minutes.
6. Serve immediately with rice.
