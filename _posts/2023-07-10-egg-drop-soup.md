### Egg Drop Soup:
- Prep time: 5 minutes
- Cook time: 10 minutes

### Ingredients (serves 4)
- 4 cups chicken broth
- 1 tsp turmeric (for color)
- 2 eggs
- 2 tbsp cornstarch
- scallions (optional)
- black pepper (optional)

### Directions
1. Mix the cornstarch with half a cup of water
2. Beat the eggs lightly, the whites and yolks do not need to be completely mixed
3. Bring the chicken broth and turmeric to a boil
4. Lower the heat and stir in the cornstarch water
5. Stir the pot with a soup ladle. The soup should be simmering but not boiling, and it should be moving fast but not so fast that it risks being splashed over the side. While stirring, slowly pour the egg mixture into the soup in a narrow stream. The spinning motion will cause the egg to solidify into narrow ribbons.
6. Once the egg is stirred in the soup is ready to serve. If desired, top with diced scallions (for color).

### Variations:
- If you want more vegetables, you can drop in some frozen peas or corn.
- In winter months, I like to give it a little more spice by upping the turmeric and adding some black pepper.
- For a fancy twist you can add thinly sliced shiitake mushroom and dried purple laver (seaweed). If you do this, skip the turmeric, add the mushroom and seaweed at the beginning and boil for 10 minutes before adding the egg.
