Due to the coronavirus lockdown ruining all my spring 2020 travel plans, I've been biking a lot and enjoying the beautiful weather and scenery in Folsom. Taking advantage of this opportunity to explore the trails of Folsom, I thought I'd share my thoughts on the trails on each of the trails I've been on. 

This post will cover some of the major biking trails in Folsom; I hope to regularly update this with info on more walking/biking trails in the future. Credit for the trail maps goes to [Friends of Folsom Parkways](https://enjoyfolsomtrails.org/trailsmaps.html).

### Lake Natoma Trail

This north-south trail goes down the eastern shore of Lake Natoma, from Historic Folsom in the north to Nimbus Dam in the south (it's also possible to continue on to Downtown Sacramento). The trail is mostly flat and the views of the lake are amazing.

### Willow Creek Trail

One of the paved east-west trails in Folsom, this trail ends at Folsom Blvd and Lake Natoma in the west and follows the same path as the Humbug Creek Trail for most of the middle section. It ends in the southeastern part of Folsom and connects with various trails in Empire Ranch. 

The trail passes through several wetland areas, with many small bridges where it crosses Willow Creek. The topography is flat, and it runs parallel to an old railroad for most of the western half.

### Humbug Creek Trail

Compared with Willow Creek trail, this trail doesn't go as far west, and ends in the northeastern part of Folsom (going in roughly the same direction as Blue Ravine Rd into the Briggs Ranch area). 

I prefer this trail to Willow Creek Trail; the scenery is slightly more interesting and the vegetation is lusher, but there aren't as many opportunities to step to the water's edge because the banks are steeper. The trail itself is flat.

The middle section has several possible paths, but they all go in roughly the same direction. The northernmost out of those paths will take you to a large pond near Folsom Middle School. The eastern end of the trail stops at Econome Park, but continuing north on a dirt path will take you to Folsom Lake.

### Oak Parkway Trail

Another east-west trail, it connects with the Johnny Cash Trail in the west (near the Library/Zoo/City Hall) and ends at Briggs Ranch in the east, near Econome Park. It passes through BT Collins park at the midpoint. This trail is pretty hilly and steep, and there are some barren areas without vegetation. 

Overall, I don't think the ride is as pleasant as the other east-west trails in Folsom, although the part of the Johnny Cash Trail that passes near the prison is very nice.
