A hearty vegetable soup that I like eating with bread. All the optional ingredients can be added or omitted based on how hungry you are, the most important thing is the mirepoix base. 
- If you just want a soup as an appetizer, then skip the potatoes. 
- I think this dish is a great vegetarian meal, but if you want more protein you can add frozen meatballs at the beginning.
