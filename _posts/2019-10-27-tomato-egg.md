### Ingredients (serves 2)
- eggs (3)
- tomatoes (1 large one or 2 smaller ones)
- salt
- sugar (optional)

### Directions
1. Dice the tomatoes and set them aside - I usually cut each one into 8-12 pieces depending on the size. Optionally add a small dash of sugar.
2. Crack the eggs into a container and mix them up
3. Put the tomatoes in a heated pan, and cook them on medium until they start to look/feel soft (~4-5 mins).
4. Put the eggs in, and stir so the eggs get blended with the liquid from the tomatoes.
5. Add salt and cook until the egg is cooked, while stirring so that the egg does not stick to the bottom of the pan (~2 mins). Do not overook.
6. Serve immediately with white rice or plain Asian noodles (without soup).
