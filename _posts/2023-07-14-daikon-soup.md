Danny, do you know how to make anything other than pork bone soup? Do these even count as separate recipes? 

Yes, I promise I know how to make other stuff, and yes, all the recipes are subtly different so it's impossible to list all the pork bone soup variants I know without a flowchart.

The combination of daikon (a type of radish), nagaimo (a type of yam), and marrow-filled pork bone makes a rich and hearty soup good for winter.

### Daikon Soup:
- Prep time: 15 minutes
- Cook time: 3 hours

### Ingredients (Serves 8):
- 2 lb of pork bones (the kind with marrow)
- 1 medium daikon radish (forearm-sized)
- 1 medium carrot (large-banana-sized)
- 1 fresh nagaimo (huai-shan, medium-carrot-sized)
- 2 candied dates (the kind that are dry and hard and look kind of stripey)
- salt

### Directions:
1. Peel the daikon and cut it into 1.5 inch triangular chunks. Each chunk will likely not contain an entire cross-section of radish since daikons are quite thick. The chunks do not need to be perfect or uniform.
2. Peel the carrot and cut it into 1 inch triangular chunks.
3. Peel and cut the nagaimo into similarly-sized chunks. It's very slimy and hard to grip so be careful while working with it.
4. Put everything in a large pot and cover with water, then turn on the stove.
5. When the water boils, reduce to a simmer and cook for two and a half hours. Check in after 30 minutes and skim off any foam clumps that appear at the top. If too much water boils off, add more water and bring the temperature back up.
6. Skim off any remaining impurities floating on top, add salt to taste, and serve.
