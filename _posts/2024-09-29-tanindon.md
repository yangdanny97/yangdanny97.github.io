The best way to describe this dish is a cross between oyako-don and gyu-don. Great for a quick and easy weeknight meal. 

This recipe is a variation on [another one I saw online](https://www.justonecookbook.com/tanindon/); unlike the original, this version is tuned so it can be eaten without rice.

### Tanin-don
- Prep time: 5 minutes
- Cook time: 15 minutes

### Ingredients (Serves 3)
- 1 lb thinly sliced/shaved beef
- 1 large onion
- 4-5 eggs
- bottled dashi
- mirin
- cooking wine
- scallions

### Directions
1. Cut the onion into thin slices
2. Beat the eggs and add a splash of the bottled dashi
3. Heat some oil in a wok or large pan, and cook the onions for a minute or two
4. Push the onion to the side (or remove them if using a smaller pan), and toss in the beef slices a few at a time, making sure each batch has ~30s to cook and they don't stick together
6. Pour in a generous splash of cooking wine and mirin and stir to deglaze a bit
7. Pour in the eggs, turn down the heat and cover the pan, occasionally poking away at the edges to make sure nothing sticks
8. Once the egg looks solid, it's done
9. Garnish with green onion and serve
