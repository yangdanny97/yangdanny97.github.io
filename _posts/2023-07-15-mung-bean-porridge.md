This mildly sweet porridge can be enjoyed hot or cold. Mung beans are already a fantastic source of protein, but you want even more protein/crunch you can throw in half a cup of raw peanuts at the beginning.

### Mung Bean Porridge:
- Prep time: 4 hours
- Cook time: 1.5 hours

### Ingredients (Serves 4):
- 1/2 cup dried mung bean
- 1/2 cup rice
- 1 dried orange peel (optional)
- 2 1-inch pieces of rock candy

### Directions:
1. Soak mung beans in water for 4 hours or so.
2. Drain the beans and rinse the rice.
3. Throw everything into a pot and fill the pot most of the way with water.
4. When the water boils, reduce to a simmer and stir for a bit to make sure that the sugar is mixed evenly. 
5. Simmer for an hour or two, making sure that there's enough water that it looks like slightly viscous soup (v.s. very wet rice).
6. Taste the liquid and see if it's sweet enough for your taste. If not, you can add more rock candy.
7. This may be served immediately or you can wait for it to cool down. I prefer this dish at room temperature so I let it sit for a bit. If refridgerated overnight the water will probably be soaked up, so afer you take it out of the fridge you will need to add more water and give it a stir before serving or reheating.
