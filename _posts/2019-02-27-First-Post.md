I've always wanted to try blogging, but I never really got started because I couldn't quite decide what I wanted to blog about, or which platform to use.
I wasn't sure if I wanted to blog about technical things or about life/culture, if I wanted to write serious posts or just short snippets. Twitter and Tumblr seem to be too informal and restrictive if I ever wanted to write about technical things, and Medium seems to be too fancy for short snippets of musings...

So I decided to just put my blog on this website, that way I can talk about anything I want, in whatever format I want. I expect this to contain a mix of technical things and journal entries/reflections. 
This is my first attempt at blogging, so I'm not sure how consistently I will post yet, but hopefully it goes well.
