The almonds and carrots add a rich and slightly sweet flavor that is absorbed by the dried vegetables.

This recipe requires two niche ingredients, both found at Asian supermarkets:
- dried greens - They're typically some sort of unspecified white-stemmed leafy green. Get the kind that's not pickled, and try to get a pack with less stems and more leaves.
- Chinese almonds - Get the ones at the grocery store, NOT the ones at the Chinese medicine store. If you can't find them, regular almonds are an acceptable substitute (as seen in the photo below).

### Dried Vegetable and Almond Soup:
- Prep time: 4 hours
- Cook time: 2.5 hours

### Ingredients (Serves 6):
- 1-1.5 lb of pork neck bones
- 2-3 medium carrots
- 1 small package of dried bok choy
- 1 cup chinese almonds (or 1.5 cups regular almonds)
- 6 dried jujubes
- salt

### Directions:
1. Soak the dried vegetables in water for a few hours. 
2. Rinse out any dirt and cut into 1-2 inch long pieces, discarding any stems that look too tough.
3. Peel the carrots and cut them into 1 inch triangular chunks.
4. Put the meat into the pot, cover with water, and boil for 5 minutes.
5. Take the meat out, dump the water with the gunk in it, put the meat back, and refill the pot with water.
6. Throw everything into the pot and cover with water.
7. When the water boils, stir it a bit, reduce to a simmer and cook for two hours. Check in after 30 minutes and skim off any impurities floating on top. Add more water if too much boils off.
8. Skim off any remaining impurities floating on top, add salt to taste and serve.
