Tell the story of the entire writing and publication process. Although I can't say that I know all the ins and outs from publishing this single book, I hope my story is useful - whether you're interested in publishing a book or you're just curious about how it all works.

# November 2021: Proposal

I had essentially 3 choices:
1. Publish through Apress
  - Pros:
    - The publishing company helps with editing, proofreading, and typesetting
  - Cons:
    - I had no control over the pricing of the book. I would have preferred for the book to be available for free digitally, but unfortunately that wasn't an option
2. Publish through Apress Open Access
  - Pros:
    - The e-book is free for anyone to read
    - The publishing company helps with editing, proofreading, and typesetting
  - Cons:
    - I have to pay the publishing company a flat fee
    - The book would only be available digitally, unless I paid for printed copies
3. Self publish through Amazon
  - Pros:
    - I don't have to spend any money
    - Physical copies would be more affordable, and I could distribute it electronically for free if I wanted to
  - Cons:
    - No one to help with editing/proofreading/typesetting
    - Less "legit" than being published by someone else

In the end I chose #1, because I thought that going through the whole process with the support of the publishers would be a better experience for a first time author like myself.
