Everywhere I go at Cornell, I see people with laptops decorated with colorful stickers showing off which brands they like, which companies they want to work at, and which clubs that they're involved with. Each laptop reveals some insights into its owner's identity (to the extent that someone's identity can be defined by branding, anyways). The stickers I appreciate the most are stickers that show which clubs their owner is a member of, and the more artistic stickers with no branding. I feel like these types of stickers reveal a lot more about someone's passions and interests than the thousands of tech company stickers I see every day. 

I'm a big fan of laptop stickers myself. I also use them to express bits of my personality, and although they might not represent the full picture of who I am, they make for great conversation starters for other people to learn more about me if they choose. 

Like many others, I have stickers for clubs and companies: Facebook (where I interned last summer), Cornell Data Science (my project team), and Big Red//Hacks (I'm a member of the organizing committee). They're what I consider to be my long-term involvements during my college career. Missing is the sticker for the project team I was on before I joined CDS. This isn't because I have anything against them; I got my current laptop after I left the team and my desire to display their sticker isn't strong enough to overcome my reluctance to ask my former teammates for an extra sticker.

There's a second type of stickers, which I keep on my laptop solely because they look nice. I proudly display a sticker of an Angry react, which I find to be the most unique-looking emoji because of its beautiful mango gradient. Originally, Facebook gave me stickers for every reaction, but my sister took everything besides the Angry and Sad reacts. I also have a couple of stickers from Thousand Skies: a [samoyed](https://www.etsy.com/listing/660783427/vinyl-sticker-samoyed?ref=shop_home_active_7&crt=1), a [corgi](https://www.etsy.com/listing/660781859/vinyl-sticker-cream-corgi?ref=shop_home_active_21), and a [whale](https://www.etsy.com/listing/662120983/vinyl-sticker-whale-shark-planter?ref=shop_home_active_12). I saw their stand at Corgi-con in SF last summer, and since I like cute animals (especially Samoyeds) I couldn't resist and bought a few stickers. Afterwards, I found their Etsy site and now I order some new stickers every few months. They're really great for giving to friends, so I always get several extra copies whenever I place an order. One day I'd like to raise a real samoyed (or corgi or munchkin cat or ...) but until I graduate and settle down, these stickers will have to do.

Bonus: me petting a corgi at Corgi-con:
