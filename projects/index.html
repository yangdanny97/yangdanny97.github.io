            <h4><a href="https://www.piaboc.me/work/rat-revolution" target="_blank">Rat Revolution</a> - 2024</h4>
            <p>3D polar chart of rat sightings in NYC from 2010-2023, visualized as a physical art installation.</p>
            <p>Featured at <a href="https://datathroughdesign.com/" target="_blank">Data Through Design</a>, an annual
                art exhibition taking place during Open Data Week and funded by the City of New York.</p>
            <p>The colors and form of the sculpture are inspired by <a

            <h4><a href="https://github.com/yangdanny97/chocopy-python-compiler" target="_blank">Chocopy Python
                    Compiler</a> - 2020-2023</h4>
            <p>Ahead-of-time compiler for a typed subset of Python 3 called <a href="https://chocopy.org"
                    target="_blank">Chocopy</a>, with backends targeting JVM, CIL, WASM, and LLVM. The compiler is
                written entirely in Python and the source language is a subset of
                Python, so the lexing/parsing are entirely handled by the standard library's ast module.
            </p>
            <p>I gradually built this compiler over a few years for learning/experimentation/fun, and documented each
                part on this blog.

            <p>A 200-page book introducing the basics of functional programming and the <a
                    href="https://rescript-lang.org/">ReScript</a> programming language, written to be accessible to
                those with only a basic knowledge of JavaScript.

            <h4><a href="https://yangdanny97.github.io/intro-to-d3/" target="_blank">Intro to D3</a> - 2021</h4>
            <p>Originally a tutorial for D3 v3 & v4 written by Square, I've forked and updated it for v5-v7. This new
                tutorial has been featured in various JavaScript related newsletters and publications.
            </p>
            <p>I rewrote the data binding section to provide a good resource for beginners to learn how selection joins
                work in D3 v6 and later.

            <p>A browser-based pass & play chess game, using visuals from the Fire Emblem GBA games.

                The project is written almost entirely using ReScript except for the rendering which is done using
                D3.js.
            </p>
            <p>I wrote this project to experiment with ReScript and explore atypical use cases for D3.js.

            <h4>Cornell CMS Development Team - CMSX (Course Management System) - 2020</h4>
            <p>Cornell has a custom CMS maintained by a team of students supervised by Prof. Andrew Myers.
                It has a rich set of features developed over the past decade, and is used by over 8000 students and
                course staff at Cornell.
            </p>
            <p>I joined the team as a volunteer maintainer in January 2020, and have focused on refactoring and
                code quality improvements to legacy parts of the codebase. Additionally, I drove efforts to
                improve documentation and issue tracking, and helped develop onboarding guides.

            <h4><a href="https://github.com/yangdanny97/p4-stacklang" target="_blank">Stitch</a> - a stack-based DSL for
                active networking - 2019</h4>
            <p>A bytecode domain-specific-language implemented in P4 to run on programmable switches.</p>
            <p>Stitch enables arbitrary
                computations, measurements, and modification of the network by programs encoded in
                packets.</p>
            <p> This was originally implemented as the final project for CS 6114, but has been updated to support more
                features since then.

                    href="https://github.com/yangdanny97/pathways-vis" target="_blank">Pathways</a> - 2019</h4>
            <p>
                My third and final project in CDS; we worked with the <a href="https://learning.cis.cornell.edu/">Future
                    of Learning Lab</a> to build a webapp for visualizing pathways for courses/majors at Cornell, with a
                dynamic interface implemented
                in D3. </p>
            <p>We implemented the backend in Go, and incorporated a graph-based course recommendation
                system based on 10 years of anonymized enrollment data provided by the registrar.

            <h4><a href="https://github.com/Bluefire2/xic" target="_blank">XiC (Xi Compiler)</a> - 2019</h4>
            <p>An ahead-of-time compiler for Xi (a strongly-typed, imperative, procedural language) and Xi++ (its
                object-oriented
                extension), implemented in Java and targeting x64 assembly.</p>
            <p>We developed a dataflow analysis framework and used
                it to build several optimizations including register allocation, dead code elimination,
                copy-propagation, and common-subexpressions elimination.
            </p>
            <p>This was the final project for CS 4120/4121, Cornell's (in)famous compilers practicum.</p>

            <h4>12 Hour Club - <a href="https://shiro.community/" target="_blank">Shiro</a> - 2019</h4>
            <p>The 12-hour Club at Cornell reached out to me to build a custom interface to showcase their art and
                visualizations. </p>
            <p> I worked with them for a few months and used D3.js to build
                an interactive concept map with dynamically positioned nodes and Prezi-like navigation.</p>

                    Challenge</a> - 2018-19</h4>
            <p>My second project for CDS; we built and visualized models to detect relevance and stance
                of a news article relative to a claim. Both the task and technique are outdated given recent advances in
                LLMs, but at the time it was good for learning/practice.</p>
            <p>
                The primary goal was to increase transparency and interpretability of models and results. </p>
            <p>
                We won an award from Sandia National Labs at <a

            <p>
                A travel destination recommender that returns destinations based on user's interests and preferences
                (activities, climate,
                local language/drinking age, etc). </p>
            <p>It uses custom nicheness metric calculated using network structure of
                Wikivoyage to emphasize "hidden
                gems". </p>
