		<h3>CURRENT PROJECTS</h3>
		<div class="project-item">
			<h4>Cornell CMS Development Team - CMSX (Course Management System)</h4>
			<p>Cornell has a custom CMS maintained by a team of students supervised by Prof. Andrew Myers.
				It features a rich set of features for instructors to manage courses and for students to submit
				assignments and view grades, and is used by over 8000 students and course staff at Cornell.
				I'm helping them out this semester with various bug fixes and rewriting/refactoring parts of the
				codebase to improve code quality.

		<h3>PAST PROJECTS</h3>
		<div class="project-item">
			<h4><a href="https://github.com/yangdanny97/p4-stacklang" target="_blank">Stitch</a> - a stack-based DSL for
				active networking - (2019)</h4>
			<p>A bytecode language implemented in P4 to run on programmable switches. Stitch enables arbitrary
				computations, measurements, and modification of the network by programs encoded in
				packets. This was originally implemented as the final project for CS 6114, but has been updated since.

			<h4><a href="https://cornelldata.science">Cornell Data Science</a> - <a
					href="https://github.com/yangdanny97/pathways-vis" target="_blank">Pathways</a> - (2019)</h4>
			<p>
				My third and final project in CDS; we worked with the <a href="https://learning.cis.cornell.edu/">Future
					of Learning Lab to build a webapp for visualizing pathways for courses/majors at Cornell, with a
					dynamic interface implemented
					in D3. We implemented the backend in Golang, and incorporated a graph-based course recommendation
					system based on 10 years of anonymized enrollment data provided by the registrar.

		<div class="project-item">
			<h4><a href="https://github.com/Bluefire2/xic" target="_blank">XiC (Xi Compiler)</a> - (2019)</a></h4>
			<p>A compiler for Xi (a strongly-typed, imperative, procedural language) and Xi++ (its object-oriented
				extension), targeting x64 and implemented in Java. We developed a dataflow analysis framework and used
				it to build several optimizations including
				register allocation, dead code elimination, copy-propagation, and common-subexpressions elimination.
				This was the final project for CS 4120/4121, Cornell's infamous compilers practicum.</p>

		<div class="project-item">
			<h4>12 Hour Club - <a href="https://shiro.community/" target="_blank">Shiro</a> - (2019)</h4>
			<p>The 12-hour Club at Cornell reached out to me to build a custom interface to showcase their art and
				visualizations; I worked with them for a few months and used D3 to build
				an interactive concept map with dynamically positioned nodes and Prezi-like navigation.</p>

		<div class="project-item">
			<h4><a href="https://cornelldata.science">Cornell Data Science</a> - <a
					href="https://github.com/CornellDataScience/Insights-FakeNews" target="_blank">Fake News
					Challenge</a> - (2018-19)</h4>
			<p>My second project for CDS; we built and visualized models to detect relevance and stance
				of a news article relative to a claim.
				The primary goal was to increase transparency and interpretability of models and results
				We won an award from Sandia National Labs at <a

				Destination Recommender - (2019)</h4>
			<p>
				A travel destination recommender that returns destinations based on user's interests and preferences
				(activities, climate,
				local language/drinking age, etc). It uses custom nicheness metric calculated using network structure of
				Wikivoyage to emphasize "hidden
				gems". Originally buily as the final project for INFO 4300.
