                <h4 class='about'>Welcome to my website! I'm a recent graduate from <span class="highlight">Cornell University</span>, currently taking a semester off before I start working as a software engineer at <span class="highlight">Facebook</span> this summer. </h4>
                <h4 class='about'>In addition to traveling during my time off, I plan to continue my work in the <a 
                        href="https://github.com/apl-cornell" target="_blank">Applied Programming Languages</a> group at Cornell in addition to assisting the <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/Projects/cms/cmsx/" target="_blank">CMSX</a> development team.

                <h4 class='about'>I'm interested in backend development, programming languages,
                    data science, and data visualization using D3.
                <h4 class='about'>When I get a break between my projects and exams, I like to go to
                    museums, read, and do archery. I really enjoy cooking and eating, and in my spare time I like
                    to try out new recipes in the kitchen.</h4>
