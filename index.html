                <h4 class='about'>Hi, my name is Danny Yang and I am a junior studying <span class="highlight">Computer
                        Science</span> at <span class="highlight">Cornell University</span>. </h4>
                <h4 class='about'>Here at Cornell, I am a member of <a class="nm" href="https://cornelldata.science/"
                        target="_blank">Cornell Data Science</a> and the <span class="highlight">BigRed//Hacks</span>
                    organizing committee. I have also worked on course staff for <span class="highlight">CS 3300</span>
                    (data visualization) and <span class="highlight">CS 3110</span> (functional programming).</h4>
                <h4 class='about'>I'm interested in backend development, programming language tools,
                    data science, and data visualization. My favorite languages are <span class="highlight">Python</span> and 
                    <span class="highlight">OCaml</span>.
                    Last summer I interned at <span class="highlight">Facebook</span> and I plan to return to
                    Facebook this summer (2019).</h4>
                <h4 class='about'>When I get a break between my projects and exams, I like to play music, go to
                    museums, read, and do archery. I really enjoy cooking and eating, and in my spare time I like
                    to try out new recipes in the kitchen.</h4>
