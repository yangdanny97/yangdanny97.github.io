                <h4>I graduated from <span class="highlight">Cornell University</span> in December 2019,
                     and I'm currently taking a semester off before I start working as a software engineer at <span class="highlight">Facebook</span> this summer. </h4>
                <h4 class='about'>During my time off, I am continuing my work in the <a 
                        href="https://github.com/apl-cornell" target="_blank">Applied Programming Languages</a> group at Cornell in addition to
                         assisting the <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/Projects/cms/cmsx/" target="_blank">CMSX</a> development team.

                <h4 class='about'>I'm interested in backend development, programming languages,
                    data science, and data visualization using D3.
                <h4 class='about'>My hobbies include biking, archery, reading, and going to museums. 
                    I really enjoy cooking and eating, and in my spare time I like
