                <h4 class='about'>I'm interested in backend development, programming languages,
                    data science, and data visualization. My favorite languages are <span class="highlight">Python</span> and 
                    <span class="highlight">OCaml</span>.

                <h4 class='about'>When I get a break between my projects and exams, I like to go to
                    museums, read, and do archery. I really enjoy cooking and eating, and in my spare time I like
                    to try out new recipes in the kitchen.</h4>
