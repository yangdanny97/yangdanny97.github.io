        <h4>About the Book</h4>
        <p>
            This book serves as a succinct guide on ReScript, a functional language for building web applications. Using
            examples of ReScript language features along with explanations of fundamental concepts in functional
            programming, this book will show web developers with a background in JavaScript how to effectively use
            ReScript to its full potential.
        </p>
        <p>
            In <span class="colorText">Introducing ReScript</span>, you'll learn how to use features in ReScript that
            JavaScript lacks, such as type
            inference, null-safety, algebraic data types, pattern matching, and more. Along the way, you'll pick up
            functional programming concepts like immutability and higher-order functions. You'll also gain a sense of
            how ReScript works under the hood and how to leverage interoperability between ReScript and JavaScript.
            Whether you're a web developer interested in dabbling with functional programming or you just want to learn
            how to write safer and cleaner code for web applications, this book is a great way for you to get started
            with ReScript.
        </p>
        <h4>
            What You Will Learn</h4>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use ReScript to write clean, safe, and elegant software</li>
            <li>Understand the features of ReScript that set it apart from JavaScript, such as type inference,
                null-safety, and algebraic data types</li>
            <li>Explore functional programming concepts like immutability, higher-order functions, and pattern
                matching</li>
            <li>Use popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks in your ReScript code and integrate ReScript code
                into JavaScript codebases</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Who This Book Is For</h4>
        <p>
            Web developers that want a strictly typed, safer alternative to JavaScript, as well as web developers
            interested in learning functional programming and leveraging the elegant and powerful functional features in
            ReScript.
