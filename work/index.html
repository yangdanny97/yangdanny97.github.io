        <h3>Full-Time Employment</h3>
        <p>
            I am currently not actively looking for a new job, but I'm open to hearing about interesting opportunities.
            If you have an opportunity related to
            compilers, developer infrastructure/tooling, and/or data visualization that you think is a particularly good
            fit for my
            background, feel free to shoot me an email.
        </p>
        <h3>Part-Time Contracting</h3>
        <p>
            I'm available for part-time contracting/consulting (10 hrs/wk) in data visualization and D3.js. My hourly
            rates vary depending on my current workload, currently they are: $75 for a half-hour consult, $150 per
            billable hour of work. If you're
            interested in my services, shoot me an email. I can help with the following:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>You want a specific chart, map, or dashboard built using D3.js</li>
            <li>You have an existing chart that you'd like me to recreate</li>
            <li>You have some data and want advice on the best way to visualize it</li>
            <li>You wrote some D3.js code and want feedback or debugging/optimization help</li>
            <li>You have an existing chart and want critique/feedback/suggestions from a design standpoint</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Please note that I do not accept jobs related to academic assignments, unless it's giving
            advice/feedback/debugging help.</p>
