        <h3>Full-Time Employment</h3>
        <p>
            I am currently not actively looking for a new job, but I'm open to hearing about interesting opportunities. If you have an opportunity related to
            compilers, developer infrastructure/tooling, and/or data visualization that you think is a particularly good fit for my
            background, feel free to shoot me an email.
        </p>
        <h3>Part-Time Contracting</h3>
        <p>
            I'm available for part-time contracting/consulting (10 hrs/wk) in data visualization and D3.js. My hourly
            rate varies depending on the urgency of the job and my current workload, but you can expect a rate in the
            ballpark of $75-$125/hr. If you're
            interested in my services, shoot me an email.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>If you want a particular chart, map, or dashboard built using D3.js (and other frameworks), I can do it
            </li>
            <li>If you have some data but you don't know how to display it, I can design visualizations and provide
                advice for the best way to visualize your data</li>
            <li>If you wrote some D3.js code and want feedback or debugging/optimization help, I can take a look</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Please note that I do not accept jobs related to academic assignments unless they fall under category #3.</p>
