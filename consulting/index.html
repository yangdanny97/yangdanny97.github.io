            I'm available for part-time consulting for data visualization/D3!
        </div>

        <div>
            As you can see from my <a href='{{ site.url }}/blog/'>blog</a>, I have quite a bit of experience in data visualization and building charts
            using D3. Since I don't really get to use it in my day-job, I figured that a good way to scratch my D3 itch
            is to offer my services to the internet.

        <div>
            If you want me to build you a
            cool dashboard or interactive chart using D3.js, shoot me an email or find me on <a
                href="(https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0135c6f16760131b2c)" target="_blank">Upwork</a> (rates
            negotiable).
